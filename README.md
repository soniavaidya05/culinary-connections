# culinary-connections
Culinary Connections is a Nashville-based application where users can receive restaurant recommendations on a map and connect with other users! 

INFORMATION:
Users can customize a broad range of preferences such as general location, cuisine type, takeout availability, star rating, alcohol, wifi, credit card/cash, and price range. Then, their preferences are matched to restaurants, which are displayed on a map. Yellow markers represent restaurants which match their preferences perfectly, while blue markers represent general restaurants in their area. Once a user’s restaurants are displayed on a map, they can click each marker to see “friends” with similar tastes! We simulated this aspect of the program by creating dummy users associated with each restaurant. Then, the user can enter a friend’s name, and receive an updated map with red markers representing their friend’s restaurants, and expand their tastes!

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Download the required libraries with the right versions in requirements.txt
2. Run main.py
3. Carefully follow the instructions on the new window which opens
   
IMPORTANT NOTE: Give the program some time to run once you enter your preferences! Your map will be displayed on a web browser, and another new window should open to take more input from you.
